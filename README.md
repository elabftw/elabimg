# Description

This Docker image is for [eLabFTW](https://www.elabftw.net). It runs nginx + php + elabftw.

# Tags and branches

The `hypernext` (dev) branch is built and pushed to Docker Hub on a "push" event as well as on a daily schedule.

The `master` branch is built for the `latest` tag on Docker Hub and contains the latest eLabFTW version.

A tag with the latest released eLabFTW version is also pushed. Example: elabftw/elabimg:4.0.11.

# Building this image

Set the `ELABFTW_VERSION` to a tagged release or a branch. The latest stable version can be found [here](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/latest).

~~~bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg ELABFTW_VERSION=X.Y.Z -t elabftw/elabimg:X.Y.Z .
~~~

# Usage

An example configuration file for docker-compose can be fetched like this:

~~~bash
curl -so docker-compose.yml "https://get.elabftw.net/?config"
~~~

This will download a pre-filled configuration file.

You can then edit this file where all the options are explained in the comments.

For usage of eLabFTW, see [documentation](https://doc.elabftw.net).
