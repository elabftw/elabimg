# Nginx configuration files

## Description

This folder is copied into `/etc/nginx` in the image. It contains all the configuration files necessary for `nginx` to run.

Some configuration files contain placeholders (`%EXAMPLE%`) that are replaced by a correct value at runtime (script [prepare.sh](../init/prepare.sh)).

## Files

- `nginx.conf` is the main entrypoint, it loads files in `conf.d` folder
- `conf.d` folder will also contain a symbolic link to either `http.conf` or `https.conf` depending on what we want to run
- `common.conf` contains common configuration options for elabftw server (http or https)

## Configuration

`Nginx` is configured and compiled with only the bare minimum, see the build step in `Dockerfile`.

Custom error pages are also added.

The Diffie-Hellman group used is `ffdhe4096` from [IETC RFC 7919](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7919).
